# Homework 8: Refine Chart

**Due:** Friday, December 11, 2020 by 11:59pm

The goal of this assignment is to use data journalism/storytelling techniques to refine a chart from HW7.

## Assignment

Use principles from data journalism/storytelling to refine one of your charts from HW7.  You must include a headline that summarizes the main point of your chart (as opposed to a title that only describes your chart). You also should include annotations or context as needed.  This will be your final chart, so care should be taken in choosing fonts, colors, and other design/aesthetic aspects.

You may use Excel, Tableau, R, or Vega-Lite to complete this assignment. (But, be particularly careful about using Tableau as it may not as easily customizable as the other options, and customization is a large part of this assignment.)

## Report

Your report is an important part of this assignment. I expect your report to include your name, CS625-HW8, date, and appropriate headings and Markdown markup for clarity and neatness. You will lose points if there are many spelling or grammatical errors. 

Your report should include the following information:
* image of your draft chart from HW7
* image of your refined chart
* explanation of how your final chart answers the question you asked in HW7 and how your headline fits your chart
* description of all design decisions made in transforming from the draft to the refined chart 
    * every element on your chart should be explained and justified in your report
* discuss the visualization principles from the semester that were incorporated into the final visualization

If you use Excel, also include the spreadsheet in your repo.

If you use R, any code produce your chart be runnable and embedded in your RMarkdown report. Make sure to 'Knit' your report to produce Markdown suitable for Github and commit the .Rmd, .md, and any generated image files to your repo. 

If you use Vega-Lite, your report must include a link to the Observable notebook that contains your Vega-Lite code and chart.

As always, you must include a section titled "References", including links to any examples that you used in completing this assignment.
